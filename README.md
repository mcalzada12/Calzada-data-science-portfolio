# Calzada-data-science-portfolio
This repository is my main Data Science Portfolio. It will be used to organize and document all my data science work, including exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualizations, and basic modeling. The goal of this portfolio is to track my progress and build a structured collection of projects.


## 🛠️ Tools I Plan to Use

- Python (pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Excel
- Power BI / Tableau
- Git & GitHub
