# Calzada-data-science-portfolio
This repository is my main Data Science Portfolio. It will be used to organize and document all my data science work, including exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualizations, and basic modeling. The goal of this portfolio is to track my progress and build a structured collection of projects.

## Structure of the Projects
As I add more work, this repository will be organized into folders such as:

```text
LASTNAME-Data-Science-Portfolio/
│
├── 01-eda/                # Exploratory Data Analysis projects
│   ├── project-name-1/
│   └── project-name-2/
│
├── 02-visualizations/     # Data visualizations and dashboards
│   ├── matplotlib-seaborn/
│   └── power-bi-tableau/
│
├── 03-models/             # Basic statistical & machine learning models
│   ├── regression/
│   └── classification/
│
├── 04-end-to-end-projects/ # Projects that go from raw data to insights
│
└── README.md              # Overview of the portfolio
```
